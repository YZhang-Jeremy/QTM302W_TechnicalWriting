# NYPD Shooting Incidents Analysis

## Project Overview
This project conducts a comprehensive analysis of shooting incidents in New York City, especially examining the changes that occurred post the COVID-19 pandemic. By integrating data from the NYPD with societal indicators like unemployment rates and mental health statistics, our goal is to identify patterns and underlying factors influencing the occurrence and distribution of these incidents.

## Objectives
- To analyze the trends and patterns in shooting incidents in NYC.
- To investigate the impact of COVID-19 on these incidents.
- To correlate shooting incidents with socio-economic factors.
